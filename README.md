# Chatbot-Assistant
This project aims to design, implement, and deploy a Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer user queries. The chat assistant accepts natural language queries, converts them into SQL queries, fetches data from the database, and responds with clear, formatted answers.
